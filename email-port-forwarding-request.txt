Subject: Request for Port Forwarding Configuration for Web Server

To: support@stevens.edu

Hello Stevens IT Support,

I am running a web server on my machine for a development project and need port forwarding configured to access it from outside the Stevens network.

Request Details:
- External Port: 8080
- Internal IP Address: 10.246.103.99
- Internal Port: 8080
- Protocol: TCP
- Purpose: Web server for development/testing
- Server Hostname: HFSL-HANLON2-33
- Public IP: 155.246.151.34
- Student ID: 20027138

What I need:
Port forwarding so external requests to http://155.246.151.34:8080 are forwarded to my server at 10.246.103.99:8080.

Current situation:
I cannot access the router admin panel (10.246.103.1), so I cannot configure this myself. I am currently using ngrok as a workaround, but a direct port forwarding setup would be preferable.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any policies/restrictions I should be aware of.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
