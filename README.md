# Stevens Blockchain - Onchain Performance Metric System (OPMS)

> Turning real work, character, and collaboration into on-chain reputation.

This project is an on-chain performance metric system for the Stevens community.  
Professors and students are whitelisted by their Stevens identity, and every task, bid, and reward becomes part of a transparent, tamper-resistant record of performance.

Grades fade. A resume can be embellished.  
But a history of **real work done, stakes taken, and reputation earned** on-chain is hard to fake.

## 🪙 Token System

### Three-Token Architecture

1. **SRPC (Stevens Reputation Proof Coin)** - The Demand Engine
   - Non-transferable soulbound token
   - Distributed by Professor On-Chain Address (POCA)
   - Represents professor recognition

2. **SBC (Stevens Banana Coin)** - The Fuel & Governance
   - ERC20 fungible token
   - Used for bidding on SRPC-rewarded tasks
   - Governance token for ecosystem parameters
   - Time-locked redemption to SDC

3. **SDC (Stevens Duck Coin)** - Stevens Cash
   - ERC20 fungible token
   - Redeemable anytime (cash equivalent)
   - Entry/exit point for the ecosystem

See [docs/tokenomics/TOKENOMICS_REFINEMENT.md](docs/tokenomics/TOKENOMICS_REFINEMENT.md) for detailed tokenomics.

## 🔧 Development

### Smart Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
forge build          # Compile contracts
forge test           # Run tests
forge script script/DeployNewContracts.s.sol  # Deploy
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend/sbc-frontend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Build for production

## 📖 Core Features

### 1. Whitelisted Academic Community
- `StudentManagement.sol` binds **Stevens IDs** to on-chain addresses
- Only whitelisted users can hold, transfer, and interact with tokens

### 2. Task System
- **SRPC-rewarded tasks**: Created by POCA, students bid SBC
- **SBC-rewarded tasks**: Created by all whitelisted users

### 3. Governance
- SBC holders vote on ecosystem parameters:
  - Redemption lock period
  - Lending interest rates
  - Professor Token Distribution System parameters

### 4. Lending & Exchange
- Borrow SBC using SRPC as collateral
- Swap SBC ↔ SDC via AMM/CEX
- Redeem SDC to cash anytime

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.24, Foundry
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Ethers.js
- **Infrastructure**: Nginx, PM2

## Summary

The refined tokenomics model creates a sustainable economic ecosystem:

1. **SRPC (Demand Engine)**: Creates demand through scarcity and real-world value
2. **SBC (The Fuel & Governance)**: Powers the system through deflationary bidding mechanism and governance voting
3. **SDC (Stevens Cash)**: Provides liquidity and cash bridge

The system ensures:
- **Authenticity**: Non-transferable SRPC
- **Scarcity**: Controlled distribution and burning
- **Value**: Real-world opportunities for high-SRPC students
- **Liquidity**: SDC enables easy entry/exit
- **Governance**: SBC holders control ecosystem parameters
- **Commitment**: Time-locked redemption maintains engagement while providing exit path

**Key Innovation**: Time-locked redemption mechanism balances the need for commitment (deflationary model) with user flexibility (exit option), while governance ensures the system remains adaptable and community-controlled.

*This refinement maintains the core economic principles while adding governance capabilities and a balanced redemption mechanism that preserves the deflationary model.*
